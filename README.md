# Timer for Websites That Steal Your Time

This project helps to control time was spent on sites. It requires special extension for Chrome browser.

# Installing

Install extension for Chrome browser [Custom JavaScript for websites](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija).

Open configuration of [cjs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) browser extension on the site you want to controll. Click on the link "your own external scripts", add path [https://eremeevfd.github.io/34_timemachine/index.js](https://eremeevfd.github.io/34_timemachine/index.js) or **your own script source**. Don`t forget to press "enable cjs for this host" to enable custom JS.

Page will reload and you should see nice timer in the left corner. When it expires you will get alerts every 30 seconds with motivational quotes to proceed your job and stop surfing the net. 

For faster development you can use JS code hosted on localhost. Simple web server can be used for that, run:

```bash

python3 -m http.server
```

Add path `http://localhost:8000/index.js` to [cjs](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija) browser extension. Done.
